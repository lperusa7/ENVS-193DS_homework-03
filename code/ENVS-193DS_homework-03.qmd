## Setup

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(flextable)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)

# read in personal data
personal <- read_csv(
  # file path
  here("data", "ES193DS_Personal_Data.csv"))
```

# Problem 1: Personal Data

## a. 

For my personal data, I'm observing how many tasks I complete in a given study session, while listening to different genres of music during each study session to then be able to see if the music genre has an affect on my productivity rate. I then use the number of tasks completed to then calculate my productivity rate, to then compare the change in my productivity rate, which is (number of tasks / time), based on the different categories of music genres.

## b.


```{r, data-cleaning}
# creatig clean data frame
personal_cleaned <- personal |> # choosing personal data frame
  # cleaning column names
  clean_names() |> # cleaning names
  select(date, study_period, music_genre, work_environment, time_of_day, sleep, productivity) # selecting columns for cleaned data frame
```

```{r, making-plot}
ggplot(data = personal_cleaned, # choose data frame
       aes(x = music_genre, # assign x-axis
           y = productivity, # assign y-axis
           fill = music_genre)) + # assign boxes by music_genre
  geom_boxplot(color = "black") + # make box plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(    # assign custom colors to each genre
    "Classical" = "#66c2a5",
    "No Music" = "#ffd92f",
    "Lofi" = "purple",
    "Indie Rock" = "darkgrey"
  )) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making points jitter horizontally
              alpha = 0.5, # making points slightly transparent
              color = "black") + # making points black
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # calculate the mean of productivity for each music genre
             geom = "point", # add a point at the mean value
             color = "firebrick", # set the point color to a muted red for emphasis
             size = 3) + # increase point size for visibility
  labs(x = "Music Genre", # changing label for x-axis
       y = "Productivity (Tasks completed per hour)", # changing label for y-axis
       title = "Average Task Completion Rate Based on Music Genre") + # adding title name
  theme_minimal() + # adding minimal theme
  theme(legend.position = "none") # getting rid of legend
```

## c.

**Figure 1. Productivity Rate is higher when listening to Classical and Lofi music**
Data from 'ES193DS_Personal_Data.csv' (Lescano, L. 2025).
Points represent individual study period productivity rate (total n = 16), jittered horizontally to reduce overlap. Bold horizontal line represents the mean productivity rate for the group.

## d.

```{r, summarizing-data}
# Step 1: Summarise the data by music genre

summary_table <- personal_cleaned |> # creating summarized data object
  group_by(music_genre) |> # group rows by music genre
  summarise(mean_productivity = round(mean(productivity, # calculates mean within each group
                                           na.rm = TRUE), 1))
# Step 2: Create and format flextable

flextable(summary_table) |> # create a table from the summary data
  set_header_labels( # rename column headers for clarity
    music_genre = "Music Genre",
    mean_productivity = "Mean Productivity (Tasks Completed per Hour)"
  ) |> 
    align(j = "mean_productivity", align = "center", part = "all") |> #center values in productivity column
  autofit() |> # auto-adjust column widths to fit content
  add_header_lines("Average Productivity Rate by Music Genre") # add a custom title above the table
```

# Problem 2: Affective Visualization

## a.

An affective visualization of my personal data could take the form of a stylized soundwave, where each genre is represented by a different color and the line thickness represents my productivity level. If one music genre has a higher productivity rate, then the peaks will be greater and it will appear more like a crecendo. This would visually and emotionally connect the act of studying with the type of music I was listening to, blending form with feeling. The visualization would not only communicate data, but how it felt to study with each kind of music, ultimately by the difference in productivity rates visually represented.

## d.

This piece visualizes how different music genres impacted my productivity during study sessions. Each wave represents a genre, with the height and flow of the line representing the average rate at which I completed tasks, translating data into emotional rhythm.
I was inspired by the affective visual strategies of Jill Pelto, who integrates data into landscape art, and the Dear Data project by Posavec and Lupi, which emphasized personal, emotional storytelling through visual abstraction. I aimed to combine sound wave aesthetics with gentle color gradients to create a sense of movement and tone.
The form is a hand-drawn illustration, using colored pencil and ink to create layered waveforms that reflect the amplitude of productivity across music genres. The organic lines and textures evoke a more personal, emotional connection to the data.

# Problem 3: Statistical Critique

## a.

The t-test statistically compares whether the mean program budgets differ significantly between groups (ex. rural vs. urban or disadvantaged vs. non-disadvantaged communities), directly testing the authorsâ€™ question about distributional inequities. If the test yields a significant result (ex. p < 0.05), the authors would conclude that there is evidence of disparities in energy efficiency budgets between the compared groups, which supports their claim of systematic inequalities being tied to rurality, income, or disadvantaged status.

## b. 

The table clearly represents the data underlying tests through displaying a t-test was used and its purpose being to evaluate whether the average value of each variable differs significantly between high-budget and low-budget jurisdictions. Additionally, the variables help the reader assess whether environmental justice or resource access varies by program budget. The test was displayed in a informative format including degrees of freedom, which provides context about sample size and the reliability of the statistical test, the test statistic, and the test value, which describes if there is a meaningful difference between the two groups. 

## c.

The table is clean and well-organized with the only possible visual clutter being the test result values since it includes test statistic, degrees of freedom, and test value, but this is very informative and is designed that way purposefully. Asterisks are used to denote significant differences between the top and bottom quartiles. The title columns are bolded, engaging the reader to discover the meaning and purpose of the columns.

## d.

Table 2 is clearly organized and allows the reader to compare characteristics between high and low- budget jurisdictions. However, several changes could be made to improve clarity and impact. First, I would recommend bolding the most meaningful test results in the "Test Results" column, for example the Tax Revenue (USD) test result, to visually draw attention to the most impactful results from the table. Secondly, the units of measurement for some of the variables, like IRR, should be included and possibly including context for what a Median CES Score of 20 means, like what the range of scores could be and there meaning. Finally, the authors could include a figure (such as a boxplot) alongside the table to visually support the statistical differences and make the results more accessible to visual learners. These changes would enhance the communicative power of the table and make key disparities easier to identify at a glance.
