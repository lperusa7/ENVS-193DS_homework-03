Homework 3 repository 

## General Information

This repository is for my Homework 3 assignment for Environmental Studies 193DS. In this assignment, I analyzed personal data by creating visualizations, including a boxplot and a summary table. I also developed an affective visualization, and in Problem 3, I conducted a statistical critique of a published study.
